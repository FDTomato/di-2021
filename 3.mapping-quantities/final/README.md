## Project 3 Final Description

The title is "Effectiveness of the NPT"
NPT Stands for “Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons”.
“The NPT is a landmark international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament.”  --United Nations, Office for Disarmament Affairs
